Differential.txt

To complie and run all code for this sections type "make diff".

Abel to achieve 55% coverage, coverage output is in "diff.out".

Differentiator code is in "run.c". Was able to achieve a difference
in the number of cards in a the hand. The log of the diff is in the
text file: "difffile.txt". 

The diff code works when a full implementation of the dominion code
(ie. dominion.c dominion.h rngs.c rngs.h imp.... and so on) is downloaded
into a two seprate folders. The folder paths are then fed into the
program as parameters. This setup is included in my submission for ease
of compilation.


		simply type "make diff"
