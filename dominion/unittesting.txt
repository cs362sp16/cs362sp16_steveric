use make all to generate all files

i found what i think to be bugs in a the isGameOver() function and the smithy function.

i found that i am struggling with the testing philosophy. the coverage gave me an idea
about how much of the test code i was covering, but because of the way that i wrote my 
tests this did not give me much further insight into the bugs to that could be found
in the tests.

this exercise taught me alot. gcov seems to be a valueable tool. i also got a lot more 
experience with the make utility, which i was greatful for.
