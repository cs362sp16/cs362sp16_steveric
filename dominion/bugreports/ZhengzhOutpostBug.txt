Smith Bug Report: 
Date: June 6, 2016
Report Author: Eric Stevens

Description:
The functionality of the outpost card is not working properly. The result of
playing the outpost card is supposed to be a decreased draw at the end of 
the clean up phase and the ability to take one more, for a maximum of two
turns total. Neither of these functionalities are built into the system.

Occourance:
Whenever the outpost card is played the bug will present itsself.

Fix:
there is already a variable built to track the status of the outpost card.
adding and if statement that looks to see if the outpost has been played 
and then changes the number of turns left and the number of cards to be 
drawn at clean up should fix this problem.

Severity:
This problem is of medium severity. This completly defeats the purpose of 
using the card, but it is not as popular of a card as others. 

Priority:
The complex nature of the fix makes this card less desirable to fix. Medium 
priority should be placed on fixing this bug.
